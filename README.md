# learning-for-Code-audit
If you are the beginner of Code audit you will need itï¼Œif not you can recommend this platform to those who need it.

In the process of my code auditing, I found that there is not a very good teaching material. Most of them are fragmented blog posts or vulnerability descriptions. It is not conducive to systematic learning code auditing techniques. Therefore, I intend to open source my own finishing and construction. The code audits beginners' training platform. 

# The contents include:
1.the classification of various vulnerabilities in the code audit
2.the use of the docker and the original cms platform 
3.attached a detailed use of screenshots and text 

My purpose is only for everyone's learning and reference, but also a test of my skill level.
